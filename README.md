# Cleverbit Coding Task Task Template

An angular client has been added to the angular folder that connects to this backend, be sure to run npm install then npm start to run it.

# Seeding matches
At the moment 3 matches get seeded in memory each with expiry date a minute away

# Notes
Although there still has some elements to work on (session following on client side/whether client is signed in or not)
This task has proven to be a lot of code in regards of implementing it in a SOLID way following Patterns (like repository, dependency injection, DDD).

I hope I have managed to show a proper architectural structure around the code both in the backend and in the frontend in this alloted time.
